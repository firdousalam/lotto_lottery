		hoosierlotteryhelper.com is a THINK project. This website exists primarily to make public a sophisticated college programming project. The program took a full year to create, and has been modified and updated over the last 5 years, with a new expanded version being created in 2015. The program started from a stats class I had. My teacher Eric Millner had an obsession with the lottery. He had an excel spread sheet that I caught him looking at countless times when I would go to his office (I always visited my teachers in their office). One day I just asked him what it was, Coffee, a few trips to the bathroom, and 7 hours later I knew how crazy he was. He was devoting countless hours maintaining a spreadsheet of lottery winners and running analysis on them. Making charts, graphs, prediction sets. I knew I could save him so much time by writing a program. So I did. Problem was I was a freshman. I was just taking my first programming class. It was VB, yeah, Visual Basic. I knew I would have to take 2 years of java, and 3 other classes that would also depend directly on java. I decided to teach myself java. So I started writing this program in java…<br><br>

		Now, that program is not this program. I wrote a basic program to help Eric out in the first 3 months. Over the next 15 months everything I needed to learn in Java I learned from writing this program. Everyday I would spend 2 or 3 hours programming on this program to sharpen my programming, math, and logic skills. I implemented every searching algo, experimented with custom data objects and classes, tested recursion, ran time analysis, everything. I did everything over that 15 months. I walked out of java 201 and 202 with an A+ in each thanks to this program. It didn’t stop there. I got very interested again when taking advanced statistics and a data management class. I revisited the program a rewrote it. This time I decided to study the lotto. This time I decided to find the most logical approach to picking numbers. Something mathematical, something I could prove. I looked at pairs, sequential patters, odds vs even, low and high ranges, frequency occurrence, averages, pick distribution patterns. I looked at everything. I began to add this to my program, I was going to win the lotto. Then I got a job. I started my career, and for some time the program was dead. I played with it sometimes, but for the most part it was dead. For a year almost, then I got a phone call. A guy had read the case study I published on search algorithms on my blog that actually showed the inner workings of my program. He asked me if I was interested in selling the code. We talked and I ended giving him access to use the program but not see or own the code for a three year contract. He started a Lotto Prediction membership website based on my program. In early 2015 when that contract ended I got a renewal notice from him. Turns out he was making $600 a day playing the lotto and about $10,000 a month from the website built on the program data. So I decided I would not renew a contract with him and instead I would tweak my program for very specific games and start my own series of sites. This site is one of them. I hope you enjoy.<br>
